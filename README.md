# Medalyst React Native Homework ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Open QR code with Expo Go:

## Design steps

- React Native application was created based on [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- API integration was added with Typescrcipt based on [SWAPI docs](https://swapi.dev/documentation#people).
- Test cases were added using `@testing-library/react-native` because `react-test-renderer` is [deprecated](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide#deprecated-react-test-renderer).
- The app is using a custom hook (`useSearch`) to leverage the search functionality.
- Next steps could be a _new stack screen_ to display the details of the characters.
